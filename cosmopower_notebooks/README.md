# notebooks

This folder contains notebooks showing how to train and obtain predictons from ``CosmoPower`` emulators. Specifically:

- the [getting_started_notebooks](https://github.com/alessiospuriomancini/cosmopower_public/blob/main/notebooks/getting_started_notebooks) subfolder contains examples of how to run pre-trained ``CosmoPower`` models, to obtain predictions for matter and CMB power spectra given input parameters;

- the [training_notebooks](https://github.com/alessiospuriomancini/cosmopower_public/blob/main/notebooks/training_notebooks) subfolder contains notebooks to train ``cosmopower_NN`` and ``cosmopower_PCAplusNN`` models;

- the [likelihoods_notebooks](https://github.com/alessiospuriomancini/cosmopower_public/blob/main/notebooks/likelihoods_notebooks) subfolder contains examples of how to run likelihoods that source power spectra from ``CosmoPower`` models.
